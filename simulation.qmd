## Exercise 05: Loading in Custom Package

```{r}
library(ppol6819.assignment04)
set.seed(20260224)
```

## Exercise 06
```{r}
library(purrr)
library(tidyverse)

# Iterate ten toin cosses, 10,000 times and count number of heads.

for(i in 1:10000) {
  
  # N is number of flips, P is probability of heads. 
  toss <- cointoss(n = 10, p = 0.6)
  # Setting names instead of 0 and 1. Might be unnecessary
  toss <- if_else(toss == 1, "heads", "tails")
  # Counts # heads in the iteration
  heads[i] <- sum(toss == "heads")
  # Creating a tibble for visualization
  result <- tibble(heads = heads,
                   iteration = 1:10000)
  
}

# Histogram
ggplot(result, aes(x = heads)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Exercise 07
```{r}
library(purrr)
library(tidyverse)

# Random walk with 10,000 steps with equal likelihood of moving either 1 step forward or 3 back.
walk <- random_walk(nsteps = 10000,
            stepsize = c(1, -3), 
            prob = c(0.5, 0.5))

# Visualization 
walk |>
  ggplot(aes(x = step_number, y = location)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal()
  

```
