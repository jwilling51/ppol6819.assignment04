## Exercise 05: Loading in Custom Package

```{r}
library(ppol6819.assignment04)
```

## Exercise 06
```{r}
library(purrr)
library(tidyverse)

# Iterate ten toin cosses, 10,000 times and count number of heads.

for(i in 1:10000) {
  
  # N is number of flips, P is probability of heads. 
  toss <- cointoss(n = 10, p = 0.6)
  # Setting names instead of 0 and 1. Might be unnecessary
  toss <- if_else(toss == 1, "heads", "tails")
  # Counts # heads in the iteration
  heads[i] <- sum(toss == "heads")
  # Creating a tibble for visualization
  result <- tibble(heads = heads,
                   iteration = 1:10000)
  
}

# Histogram
ggplot(result, aes(x = heads)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal()
```
