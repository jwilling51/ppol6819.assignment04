The package contains two custom functions. 
-  <b> cointoss() </b>: Simulates n, number, coin tosses where each flip returns 1 (heads) with probability (p) and 0 (tails) with probability (1-p).
-  <b> random_walk() </b>: Simulates a number of steps, nsteps, where each step is randomly drawn from two options, step_one and step_two, with different magnitudes and probabilities.
